# Cebu Provincial Dashboard

## Overview
The Cebu Provincial Dashboard was developed as part of the Data Associate Certification in Project SPARTA. Its primary goal is to support Cebu Province authorities in resource allocation, planning, and demographic comparisons across municipalities and cities. The dashboard also highlights the relationships among unique tourist attractions, population sizes, infrastructure, business climates, and talent outputs.

## Interactive Dashboard Design
The main tab of the workbook features an interactive dashboard that allows users to select specific municipalities or cities. Visuals update automatically to reflect the selected areas, facilitating comparative analysis and providing quick insights. Visual hierarchies are employed to enhance data exploration and understanding.

### Data Sourcing and Preparation
The data source is from [Digital Cities PH](https://www.digitalcitiesph.com/) and is filtered for Cebu Province only. Since there was no structured table available, I manually scraped the data and pasted it into the Excel workbook under the Extracted_Data (Raw) worksheet, organizing the data for easy referencing.

### Data Cleansing and Transformation
Advanced Excel formulas, including INDEX, SEARCH, and MID, were used to cleanse and transform the data. These formulas automated referencing and lookups, ensuring the data was accurately prepared for analysis.

### Data Finalization and Loading
A final table was created from the transformed data, preparing it for in-depth analysis and exploration.

#### Impact
As a resident of Bantayan Island, I recognize significant opportunities for growth in areas such as education, business environment, and tourist attractions. By leveraging insights from the dashboard and actively participating in local development efforts, I aim to inspire and lead my fellow Bantayanons. My commitment to becoming a role model will help drive positive change and progress in our community, setting a standard for continuous improvement and development.
