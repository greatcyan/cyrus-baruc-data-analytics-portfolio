## Revenue Analytics

### Overview
This report will support the P&L Review, enabling the Revenue Accounting team to investigate revenue buckets/streams with significant deviations from expected amounts. Expected amounts are based on the Average Unit Revenue (AUR) from the last 12 months rather than validating top customers as done previously using SAP Analysis for Office. Due to its limitations with large data volumes, automating data preparation and utilizing Power BI's features for user interactivity and data visualizations, this project has been successfully deployed to users, resulting in significant time savings and a more efficient decision-making process.

### Visualizations
#### Summary
This Power BI report has several pages dedicated to each revenue bucket, with a summary page that compares each revenue stream and highlights those with significant impact.

#### Other Pages
All revenue buckets can be navigated through separate navigation buttons, each offering detailed information on revenue, units, calculation specifics, and the analytics page accessible via radio buttons. This functionality is achieved using bookmarking capabilities within Power BI.

### The Process
The stages below represent the end-to-end process of every BI project, which is consistent across other projects I've developed:
- Requirements Gathering: This phase involves gathering and documenting the specific requirements for the report.
- Creating Technical Specifications: Based on the requirements, technical specifications are created to outline how the report will be developed.
- Report Development: The actual development of the report takes place, including data integration, visualization creation, and dashboard design.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): The report is tested by end users to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly.
- Deployment: Once the report passes UAT, it is deployed to the production environment for use by stakeholders.
- Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance and updates to the report are performed as needed to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.
