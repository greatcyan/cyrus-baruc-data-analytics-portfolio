# Power BI Best Practices 

## Planning

- **Plan and Document Data Transformation Requirements:** Define the desired output, identify relevant data sources, and outline necessary transformations.
- **Document Data Source Credentials:** Ensure credentials are properly documented and securely stored to maintain organization and consistency.
- **Select Appropriate Connectors:** Consider data source type, location, volume, and connectivity options. Evaluate performance and scalability of connectors.
- **Perform Expensive Operations Last:** Follow best practices by scheduling resource-intensive operations towards the end of the transformation process.

## Data Transformation

- **Prioritize Resource-Intensive Operations:** Schedule complex calculations and large dataset merges towards the end for faster data loading.
- **Carefully Select Data Types:** Improve performance and accuracy by manually adjusting inferred data types and reducing memory consumption.
- **Utilize Data Profiling:** Leverage Power BI's data profiling to understand data quality, structure, and distribution for informed decision-making.
- **Implement Error Handling and Validation:** Ensure smooth data processing by incorporating error handling and validation checks.

## Data Modeling

- **Optimize Model Performance:** Remove unused columns and tables using tools like Bravo and Power BI Helper to identify inefficiencies.
- **Aggregate Data Appropriately:** Use "Group By" transformations to aggregate data to the required level for visualizations.
- **Customize Date Tables:** Disable auto date/time settings to avoid hidden tables and create custom date tables for flexibility and space efficiency.
- **Prefer Star Schema:** Opt for star schema over snowflake or flat tables for easier navigation and enhanced performance.
- **Streamline Relationships:** Merge tables with one-to-one relationships and avoid unnecessary joins to optimize model performance.

## Performance Monitoring

- **Streamline Power Query Steps:** Regularly review and remove unnecessary transformations to simplify query maintenance.
- **Monitor Query Performance:** Evaluate refresh speed, resource consumption, and efficiency. Fine-tune settings like parallel loading for optimal performance.

## Data Visualization

- **Accessibility Considerations:** Ensure reports meet accessibility guidelines (WCAG), accommodate different screen sizes, and provide various export options.
- **Design Principles:** Apply color theory and design principles for visually appealing and comprehensible reports. Adjust font sizes for readability.

## Data Access

- **Secure Data Access:** Implement role-based access control, data encryption, and multi-factor authentication to protect sensitive information.
- **Maintain Data Security:** Consider security implications before sharing reports, ensuring only authorized users have access to sensitive data.
